This is a first step in building our first full web application **the AirBnB clone**. This forms the basis with which  all other projects will be based on. 
A basic console is created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.
